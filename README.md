## Food Objects

Another object affordance project using edible agar-based objects to train flies to recognise physical multisensory objects with learnt values in their environment. 
In each subdirectory, associated processing and analysis scripts can be found.

## Tracktor

A tracking algorithm published by Vivek Sridhar and publicly available here: https://github.com/vivekhsridhar/tracktor

Here only the core tracktor module was kept from the original project and was slightly modified to fit the needs of the projects.

Tracktor is mainly used in the Food Objects project but the [fly tracker](Tracking/TrackFly.py) implemented there can be adapted to many other projects.
